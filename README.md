# Kex-KPF-Maker
Archive directory &amp; sub-directories into .kpf archive for KEX engine games using Python.

This is a very quick and dirty program. I may improve it over time with better flow and possibly a tkinter GUI with buttons, maybe even writing a changelog you can shove into your KPF.

But this does everything I need / want at this moment. You can take your active dev directory, archive it, and copy that kpf archive into a game like Turok's Remaster quickly.

# HOW TO USE
- Run from command-line / terminal e.g. ``python kex_kpf_maker.py``
- Choose directory to archive
- Type KPF name, no extension necessary
- Choose path to save into

You will get terminal confirmations of success or failure, but I'm only checking if paths and names are invalid / null.
